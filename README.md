# Lamport's bakery algorithm in parallel
Two implementations of [Lamport's bakery algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport's_bakery_algorithm)
+ [bakers.ex](https://github.com/DjGusaas/bakers-algorithm/blob/master/src/bakers.ex) initial implementation in Elixir.
+ [distributed-bakers.ex](https://github.com/DjGusaas/bakers-algorithm/blob/master/src/distributed-bakers.ex) distributed implementation in Elixir.
